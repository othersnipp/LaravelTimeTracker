# LaravelTimeTracker
In keeping with extra-curricular learning, I've decided to try out the 'Build a Time Tracker with Laravel 5 and AngularJS ' tutorial on Scotch.io (https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-time-tracker-with-laravel-5-and-angularjs-part-1). Most of my work of late has revolved around backend development - this tutorial provides myself with a bit of 'variety'.
